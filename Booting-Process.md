# Boting Process

# Types of Current:-
1. Alternate current [AC] 
   In where current flows in waves like structure.
2. Direct current [DC]
   In here, current flows in straight line where positive and negative line both seprated from each other.

Computers and laptops are devices not machine.

Devices need Direct current, in normal households Alternate current came thatswhy theres a need of AC to DC Diode for the devices which as in terms of computer,laptop build in SMPS(Switch Mode Power Supply Unit) which we normally called as a charger.
